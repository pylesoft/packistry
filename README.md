### Features

- **Private Repository Support**: Keep your proprietary packages secure by hosting them in private repositories.

- **Token-Based Authentication**: Ensure secure access to your repositories with token-based authentication. This allows you to manage permissions for both users and automated systems (machines), providing granular control over who can view or modify your repositories.

- **Package Source Integration**: Easily manage and import Composer packages from various platforms:
    - **GitHub**
    - **GitLab**
    - **Gitea**
    - **Bitbucket**

  Stays up to date automatically, as Packistry uses **webhooks** to pull the latest changes from your source.

- **Comprehensive Repository Management**:
    - **Public/Private Repository Options**: Define repositories as public or private based on your project needs.
    - **Human Access Control**: Create user accounts to assign and manage access to your private repositories, ensuring only authorized individuals can interact with sensitive content.
    - **Machine Access Control**: Generate deploy tokens to allow machines (e.g., build systems or CI/CD pipelines) to access private repositories, ensuring smooth, secure automation.

- **Authentication Sources**: Packistry supports **Single Sign-On (SSO)** through OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
    - **OpenID Connect**: Authenticate using an OIDC provider, such as Okta or Microsoft Azure AD (Entra ID).
    - **GitHub**: Authenticate using your GitHub account.
    - **GitLab**: Authenticate using your GitLab credentials.
    - **Bitbucket**: Authenticate via Bitbucket's OAuth.
    - **Google**: Use Google authentication for login.

Packistry combines ease of use, flexibility, and security to give you complete control over your PHP package distribution in a self-hosted environment. Whether you're managing a private project, a team of developers, or an open-source initiative, Packistry streamlines your workflow with minimal configuration and maximum control.

### Running Packistry

You can easily run Packistry using Docker.

First, generate an app key:
```
echo APP_KEY=base64:$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

Set the APP_KEY and start the container:

```
docker run -p 80:80 -e APP_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_VALUE_FROM_STEP_ABOVE -v ./:/data ghcr.io/packistry/packistry:latest
```

Run the following command to create a user:

```
docker exec -it $(docker ps | grep ":80->" | awk '{print $1}') packistry add:user
```

Now, open http://localhost in your browser and log in with the newly created user. Note: Webhooks will not be delivered to localhost.

When using SQS, set the queue visibility timeout above Packistry's 3,600-second Composer refresh timeout. The database, Redis, and Beanstalkd connections default to 3,660 seconds.
